            <p>
                I'm a senior at the University of Central Florida, majoring in Digital Media with a specialization in Web and Interactive Media. I have a passion for art whether it's through drawing, mixed media, or crafting digital prints, creativity has consistently been at the heart of my work.
                <br></br>
                As I explored different creative paths, I'm fascinated by how thoughtful design and strategy can shape the way people interact with technology, brands, and information.
                <br></br>
                From personal projects to student organization collaborations, I've developed a strong passion for creating thoughtful, user-centered designs that blend function with aesthetic appeal.
